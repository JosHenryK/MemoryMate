# **MemoryMate**

MemoryMate interprets conversations between patients and caregivers in real time to extract key points like names, dates, and people. The device employs a unique, multimodal model to identify the state of the patient and whether intervention from a caregiver is required, intervening itself in most situations by providing a compassionate and caring response. In addition to supporting the needs of the patient, MemoryMate offers real-time summaries to care providers and the ability to schedule reminders to patients, decentralizing and democratizing home healthcare by allowing caregivers to make more informed decisions regarding patient outcomes.
